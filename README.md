AdventureWorks Business Intelligence Dashboard (Power BI)

Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world scenario where I was hired as a Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company producing cycling equipment and accessories.
The objective was to transform a collection of raw CSV files into a fully interactive Power BI dashboard that enables leadership to monitor performance, analyze trends, and make data-driven decisions.




Business Problem
The AdventureWorks management team needed a centralized reporting solution to:
•	Track key KPIs: Sales, Revenue, Profit, and Returns
•	Compare regional performance
•	Analyze product-level trends
•	Identify high-value customers
•	Enable interactive, self-service analytics
The challenge:
All inputs were provided as raw, unstructured CSV files containing transactional, product, customer, return, and territory data.

Tools & Technologies
•	Power BI Desktop
•	Power Query (ETL)
•	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
•	Relational data modeling
•	Interactive data visualization

Project Workflow
1] Data Connection & Transformation
•	Imported multiple CSV files
•	Cleaned and shaped data using Power Query
•	Standardized data types and relationships
2] Data Modeling

•	Established relationships between fact and dimension tables
•	Optimized model for performance and DAX calculations
3] Calculated Fields with DAX
Key concepts and techniques applied:

•	Filter and row context
•	CALCULATE, FILTER, ALL
•	Iterator (X) functions
•	Time intelligence (YoY, running totals)
•	Logical, text, math, and date functions
•	Dedicated measures table
•	DAX best practices
4] Data Visualization & Reporting
•	KPI cards and executive summaries
•	Line, bar, donut, area, and gauge charts
•	Tables and matrices with conditional formatting
